This repository, DyCITO+, contains the dependency and cycle information of eight test programs analyzed using DyCITO+ and TLM (Test-Level Method). In this dataset, there are two folders: classinfo and dy. In the classinfo folder, you will find {filename.csv}, ringsDy, and ringsSt. The {filename.csv} file contains basic information about the program. ringsDy represents the cycles identified by considering dynamic dependencies, while ringsSt represents those identified by considering only static dependencies.

During the analysis of dynamic dependencies, we observed that different triggering conditions could result in the repeated generation of dynamic edges between the same two classes. To address this, when calculating dependencies in {filename}.csv, we accumulate the coupling values of identical edges but avoid counting multiple occurrences of the same edge. This ensures that only unique edges are displayed. For a more thorough analysis of different triggering conditions, we provide the count of dynamic dependencies in the Dy folder, which includes all instances, regardless of duplication.

Due to memory limitations, for some larger programs, if the number of cycles within a single SCC exceeds 100,000, we halt the search and mark these cases as containing 100k+ cycles.
